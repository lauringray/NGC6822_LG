# NGC6822_LG

Work conducted June-August 2018 at the Space Telescope Science Institute as part of the SASP program, under the supervision of Dr. Margaret Meixner & Dr. Alec Hirschauer.  

These notebooks detail the process of identifying AGB candidates in NGC 6822 by evaluating whether they are to the right of a 3-sigma line in various CMDs, counting how many CMDs a source appears "red" in, evaluating the likeliness of a source being an AGB based on these counts, placing color cuts to distinguish C-rich & O-rich AGBs, and creating catalogs of the data for these selected sources, as well as a few other tasks.

There are multiple versions of each notebook, with modifications to procedure, as well as a master "function" notebook containing the most recent version of all of the functions written for this analysis.

As of September 2018, we are modifying our approach to identifying AGBs.  We have a new combined soure catalog, and AGB candidate identification will be mostly dependent on color cuts in the K vs. J-K & [3.6] vs. J-[3.6] CMDs, with the (modified) 3-sigma procedure being used to separately identify dusty sources.  The new analysis will take place in a new repository, which will be noted here when it's created.
